About

This is a sample code taken from my current project Rent-my-plot which will although is not complete will be a fully responsive full-stack application that I will then develop in React Native. 

I am particularly proud of this code because it demonstrates what I have learned and put into practice and shows my ability to create modular, maintainable code.

The application is a fully responsive React app created with vite React router 6.4, hooks (including UseState, UseEffect, and custom hooks) and deployed via netifly continuous deployment.

Designed to match as closely as possible to the existing Figma prototype.

Thoughts

To improve the code I would use TDD to unit test this application using a framework like Vitetest and run end to ends with a tool like Cypress.
